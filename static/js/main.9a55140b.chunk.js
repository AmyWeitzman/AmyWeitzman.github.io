The design was based on the real Jeopardy TV show, including various categories, multiple rounds, and wagers. However, I also used my creativity to change certain aspects of the game to make it more unique and fun for my entire family. I began by writing the logic behind the game, such as modifying the score, changing the clues, and storing the players' information. One issue I faced was determining what data structures to use to store all the data, which was large and needed to be easily accessible quickly as to not interrupt the flow of the game. I spent much time optimizing the code to make sure that is was as concise and understandable as possible. Once the back-end worked, I made the game come to life by creating the front-end, which consisted of various windows that displayed the game board, the clues, and the rules. Prior to this project, I had no experience in creating GUIs in Java so I had to teach myself the Java Swing Library. After experimenting with the different features and determining the best ones to use for my project, I coded the program, fixing bugs here and there. Ultimately, the game turned out great and I am so proud of my accomplishments. Going in, I had no idea how to build the application, but since I was motivated, I was able to teach myself along the way. Throughout this process, I learned new computer science skills, enhanced my knowledge of programming and the software engineering process, and created a game that my family could play together.",shortText:"A trivia buff and programming enthusiast whose goal is to one day be able to answer (or rather question) every clue on Jeopardy, I decided to spend one of my summers...",dates:"Summer 2018",techUsed:"Java, Java Swing",link:""},HouseHunt:{name:"House Hunt",longText:"Being stuck at home in quarantine, playing games so much they became boring, and not being as active outdoors, I decided to make a real-life Scattergories game called House Hunt that my family could play to have fun and stay in shape. Using our phones, we text a phone number to join the game and then receive a text message with a list of categories and a letter. Everyone then runs around the house, searching for objects that fit the category and start with the letter. When we find objects, we take a picture and send it to the phone number. The data is stored and when the game is over, it is fed to a website I built where we can see everyone's results and give out points for unique responses. The back-end and data processing were built with Python and the Twilio API, and the front-end website was built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You earn (and lose) points for the decisions you make as well as random things life throws at you. The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end.

Getting one\u2019s eyes examined at the optometrist\u2019s office can often be inconvenient because of people\u2019s busy schedules. Time is lost scheduling eye exams, traveling to the doctor, sitting in waiting room, and going to follow-up appointments. Additionally, the process of eye examinations can be uncomfortable. Cumbersome tests, obtrusive equipment, and discrepancies in test results and diagnoses arising from differences in clinical technicians make visual function testing significantly variable and biased. Overall, the current eye examination process is too inefficient and subjective. The goal of this project was to create a more convenient and objective way to measure vision in the clinic, and even in the comfort of one's home without interacting with another human. We used Pupil Labs, an eye tracking device, and computerized simulations to objectively measure one\u2019s contrast sensitivity and visual acuity by monitoring one\u2019s responses to stimuli prompts through the movement of their pupils. The Pupil Labs tracks the location of the user\u2019s gaze on the screen and determines whether they have correctly identified the stimulus. Using adaptive algorithms, the simulation progressively varies in difficulty according to the accuracy of the user\u2019s previous responses to find the optimal vision level. Overall, this project was a great learning experience. It was my first time performing research and utilizing external hardware in a software application. I also got to work with some amazing people.",shortText:"As part of my research at UC Irvine in the Department of Ophthalmology, I developed a more comfortable and objective visual function test....",dates:"Spring/Summer 2020",techUsed:"Python, Pupil Labs eye-tracking hardware",link:""},WikiRaces:{name:"Wikipedia Races Solver",longText:"When I first found out about Wikipedia Races, they seemed awesome!

For my final project, I built an exercise tracker called Fit Buddy that uses an accelerometer and a wifi module to keep track of the user's exercise time and step count as well as provide analysis to help them improve and reach their goals. The wifi module sends the data collected from the sensors to an AWS EC2 instance and then stores it in a Postgres database. Then, I pull the data into a data visualization and analysis tool called Dataiku to create some graphs and give the user insight into how their exercise duration and step count has changed over time and whether they are meeting their goals.

I was placed on the Job Board Data Collection team along with 5 other students. Our task was to design a job board for RTC members to more easily find and track internship and job opportunities from RTC's partner companies and then collect data to give RTC leadership actionable insight into how RTC members are using the job board and how it could be improved. Over the course of the 8 week project, our team developed a Figma prototype of the Job Board Analytics Dashboard that included in-depth, customizable analysis for RTC to review. This project was fun to work on because I learned how to use Figma and got to work with a group of amazing women from all over the country.",shortText:"When my internship for summer 2020 was cancelled at the last minute, I had trouble finding something meaningful to do over the summer to continue building my skills.

Mental illness is a major issue facing people today, especially during the pandemic. However, while it is a widespread issue, most people with mental illnesses do not seek treatment, often due to the stigma surrounding it. That's why I decided to build Ivy, a mental health chatbot that you can feel comfortable communicating with and discussing your situation knowing that you won't be judged. Ivy can also suggest resources to help you learn more about your mental illness and ways to overcome it. I built Ivy at IvyHacks, a hackathon hosted by the Ivy League universities, using IBM Watson Assistant. Then I developed a website using HTML and CSS that provides some statistics about mental illnesses to give users a better understanding of the widespread issue and know that they are not alone. Some helpful resources are also listed on the page. The Ivy chatbot on the website can help you with issues including depression, anxiety, stress, PTSD, addiction, ADHD, OCD, eating disorders, and suicidal thoughts. Based on your input, Ivy will send a response with information about your mental illness, resources such as support groups, and activity suggestions to better control your mental health. This project was my first time developing a chatbot and working with IBM Watson Assistant. It was also a great way for me to do critical research about mental illnesses and provide a safe space for people with mental illnesses to express their feelings and seek help.",shortText:"Meet Ivy, a mental health chatbot to help users find information about mental illnesses, provide resources such as support groups, and suggest activities to better control their mental health...",dates:"October 2020",techUsed:"IBM Watson Assistant, HTML, CSS",link:"https://github.com/AmyWeitzman/IvyHacks"},CommunityService:{name:"Community Service",longText:"During these crazy times of social distancing, work from home, and isolation, why not get closer with our neighbors? Everyone has unique skills and services to offer the community and what better way to utilize them than contributing to your neighborhood and offering to help those in need, whether it be phyiscally or mentally. That's why at ShellHacks I decided to make Community Service, a platform for neighbors to connect and find neighbors who are offering to help them with certain services, such as fixing home appliances, picking up groceries for the elderly, or just chatting virtually with those who feel lonely. As a neighborhood, people can help boost moral and decrease stress by continuing their daily routines. Community Service is a web app for neighbors to connect and find neighbors who are offering helpful services. Users can either post services they are offering or browse through services that other people in their neighborhood are offering. If a user would like to ask a neighbor to perform a service, they can contact them with the provided contact information. Since the group membership is moderated by someone in the group, you can ensure that everyone in the group belongs to that neighborhood and would be relatively trustworthy. Also, as a community, you know what the virus prevention requirements are and you are aware of whether the policies are being followed. Thus, this system is much more reliable than having to call a plumber and invite them into your home or physically go to a psychologist when you are depressed.

The devices can act as unique identifiers for each person as well as monitor important changes in body composition, such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, EEG, and glucose levels for medical purposes. When significant bodily changes are detected, the electrical signals produced by the body are converted to bits by a transducer, a mechanism that converts one form of energy (electrical, thermal, kinetic, magnetic) into another. The bits are then sent to a base station and over to a gateway node called a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which acts as both storage unit for data and a connection to the BAN.

A new MAC protocol called BodyMAC has been proposed to improve energy efficiency. This protocol incorporates features such as flexible bandwidth, reduced packet collision, faster transmission rates, and a Sleep Mode, which helps decrease network transmission traffic when the device is idle. The BodyMAC frame consists of three parts: Beacon, Downlink, and Uplink. The Beacon contains a description of the structure of the MAC frame, such as the number of slots for downlink and uplink, and any information that needs to be transmitted to all nodes (via broadcast). The Downlink part handles transmission from gateway to nodes, either by casting to one node specifically or all nodes by broadcasting. The Uplink part is broken down into two: Contention Access Part (CAP) and Contention Free Part (CFP). CAP utilizes Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) in which all nodes fight for access to the link for transmission. In contrast, transmission slots are handled by the gateway in CFP and each node is given a Granted Time Slot (GTS) to transmit without collisions.

Burst Bandwidth is for transmitting high urgency information lasting only a few MAC frames. A field for initial BURST-LENGTH is included in the MAC header and is decreased by 50% in the subsequent frame if that bandwidth limit is not reached. Periodic Bandwidth provides a node with sole access of the channel for a period of a few MAC frames. The nodes themselves decide how to use this bandwidth, and the bandwidth can be recycled if a node decides to remove itself from the network temporarily. Adjust Bandwidth determines, based on the previous frame, how much more or less bandwidth to include for the next frame.

The gateway decides whether to grant the sleep request based on the parameters passed and whether the gateway has information it needs to send to the node immediately.

designing the networks to ensure the safety of both the human and the data being transmitted. First of all, since the batteries for the device must be small enough to fit in a human and they are not easily replaceable since that may require surgery, the batteries must be very efficient to promote durability and longevity. Furthermore, since the range of devices in a BAN is short (only a few meters) and there are not many nodes on the network (under a few hundred),  a star topology is commonly used for the network. An advantage of the star topology is that it allows for better synchronization between the gateway and the nodes. Moreover, an important aspect to keep in mind when designing BANs is that they will need to be able to support mobile devices since people are free to move around. Additionally, BANs can serve a variety of applications, from simple data transfers with lenient time limits to urgent medical information that must be transmitted in real-time. As a result, the network is built for flexible uplink and downlink bandwidth and includes a Sleep Mode to improve energy efficiency. Some devices on the network operate using TCP while others, such as those for medical devices, need to use UDP due to the urgency of data retrieval for emergency situations; there cannot be time wasted with congestion control overhead. Moreover, one concern with BANs is that physical characteristics, such as one\u2019s height and weight, one\u2019s fat content, and the location of the device within the body, can affect the propagation speed of signals or distort the signals through absorption."}),Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"img",children:[Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:Q,alt:"Concept of a Body Area Network",width:"550px"}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{className:"img-caption",children:["Concept of a Body Area Network, ",Object(i.jsx)("i",{children:"Renesas"})]})]}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"There are a variety of applications for this technology, the main one being healthcare. First of all, BANs can allow doctors to monitor patients\u2019 physical health and make necessary adjustments to their treatment remotely without needing to directly meet with the patient. For instance, if a patient\u2019s pacemaker is malfunctioning or detecting that the patient is having heart issues, an emergency signal can be sent through the BAN to the doctor to alert them of the issue and prompt action. This saves patients time and money because they will not need to travel to the doctor for an appointment. Additionally, BANs are useful for early-detection of diseases. For example, a device connected to one\u2019s body can track physical features of one\u2019s health, such as heart rate and blood pressure, to determine if there is an abnormality so that one can seek medical attention before the symptoms progress."}),Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"img",children:[Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:X,alt:"BANs Connect to Healthcare Providers",width:"550px"}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{className:"img-caption",children:["BANs Connect to Healthcare Providers, ",Object(i.jsx)("i",{children:"B.

Since the devices in a BAN have uniques identifiers (HBIC) specific to one\u2019s body, everyone can be uniquely identified and there is no need for less secure means of authentication such as passwords and fingerprints. People can simply authenticate by placing a body part on a scanner which reads the appropriate information from the person\u2019s device. It becomes harder for hackers to steal someone\u2019s identity and gain access to secure data. HBICs can be used as a sort of ID card, containing personal information about each individual, including one\u2019s name, address, phone number, blood type, and bank account information. Being able to definitively identify individuals would help decrease unauthorized access to sensitive information and protect people\u2019s privacy. Likewise, storing all this information literally on one\u2019s person would eliminate the need to carry around ID cards, which could be lost or stolen, resulting in identity theft."}),Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"img",children:[Object(i.jsx)("img",{src:V,alt:"BANs Provide Privacy and Security",width:"550px"}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{className:"img-caption",children:"BANs Provide Privacy and Security"})]}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"Overall, BANs are the network of the future.

Also, with the rapid growth of big data, it is hard for network security to keep up.

Not only will kids learn about the signing of the Declaration of Independence, they could be present at the actual event. Or, no longer will one need years of intense training to become an astronaut. All a student will need is a VR headset in order to explore outer space. Riding a dinosaur or swimming in a volcano can become virtual realities.
